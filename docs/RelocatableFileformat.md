# Relocatable file format reference

This document details the format of the LINK-80 relocatable files that Nestor80 generates when the build type of the generated file is "relocatable".
The information here comes mainly from the original MACRO-80 manual, but extra information that was missing in the original manual has been added
after doing some reverse engineering of `.REL` files generated by MACRO-80.

## File structure: bit stream

Relocatable files are encoded as bit streams, this means that the contained items are one or more bits in size and (except where otherwise noted) are not aligned to byte boundaries.
Thus parsing a `.REL` file implies reading and interpreting bits one by one (or in groups of two or more, but not aligned at the start of a byte).

Spaces added between bits in the examples in this document are for readability only and don't imply any special boundaries in the actual data.

## Items in a relocatable file

A relocatable file can contain three types of items:

1. Absolute bytes, to be interpreted and linked "as is".
2. Relocatable value, these are 16 bit values that are relative to the starting location of the code segment, the data segment or a COMMON block.
3. Link items, allow handling other types of information such as segment or location counter changes, external symbol references, public symbol declarations, or program "metadata".

## Absolute bytes

Absolute bytes are encoded as a single `0` bit followed by the 8 bits of the byte. For example, the sequence of bytes 1, 129, 255 is encoded as:

```
0 00000001 0 10000001 0 11111111
```

## Relocatable values

Relocatable values are encoded as three bits, the first one is always `1` and the next two indicate the segment the value belongs to, followed by the 16 bits of the value in little endian. The segment bits are:

* `01` for the code segment
* `10` for the data segment
* `11` for a COMMON block

for example the data segment relative value 1234h is encoded as:

```
1 01 00110100 00010010
```

## Link items

Link items are encoded as the following sequence of items:

1. Three fixed bits, `100`.
2. A 4 bit link item type code.
3. An optional (depends on the link item type) relocatable value (two segment identification bits + 16 value bits)
4. An optional (depends on the link item type) symbol bytes field consisting of:
   * 3 bits indicating the field size in bytes.
   * The symbol bytes, as many as the size field indicates.

_Despite its name, the "symbol bytes" field doesn't always hold information about a symbol._

Whether a link item has a relocatable value, symbol bytes or both is determined by the link item type code as follows:

* 0 to 4: symbol only.
* 5 to 7: address and symbol.
* 8 to 14: address only.
* 15: Neither (special "end of file" item).

For example, a "define public symbol" item (type code: 7) with a value of 1234h in the data segment and a symbol name of `XYZ` would be encoded as follows (symbol characters are to be interpreted as their ASCII values):

```
100  0111   10 34h 12h   011     XYZ 
     type    address    length  symbol
```

## Link item types

These are the defined link item types with their codes:

### 0: Declare symbol

There's an entry of this type at the beginning of the relocatable file for each public and external
symbol that is used afterwards in the file.

### 1: Select COMMON block

Indicates that further items are to be considered included in the COMMON block of the specified name.

### 2: Program name

Indicates the program name as defined with a `NAME` instruction or with a `TITLE` instruction in the source code.

### 3: Request library search

Contains a file name specified by a `.REQUEST` instruction in the source code.

### 4: Extension link item

This is an extension mechanism that allows to define additional link items, the items generated by MACRO-80 and Nestor80 are listed in its own section.

### 5: Define the size of a COMMON block

The value is the size of the common block of the specified name, defined by the last address used in the block plus one. For example, the following code:

```
common /FOO/
org 100h
db 1
end
```

will generate a relocatable file size for the COMMON block `FOO` will be 101h.


### 6: Chain external

External symbol references in relocatable files are chained: each location in which the linker will put the resolved value holds another address that will also be the destination for the resolved value, and so on until a value of absolute zero is found.

This link item points to the head of such a chain: the value field holds the location and the symbol field is the external symbol name.

For example, if a relocatable file contains:

1. An absolute zero (16 bits) value at address 1234h in the code segment.
2. A relocatable value "code 1234h" at address ABCDh in the data segment.
3. A "chain external" link item whose address field is "data ABCDh" and whose symbol field is `FOO`.

then the linker, once it resolves the actual value of FOO, will put it in the "code 1234h" and "data ABCDh" addresses.

### 7: Define public symbol

Holds the name and the value of a symbol declared as public in the source code. The linker resolves external references by searching for matching public symbols in the other relocatable files involced in the linking process.

### 8: External minus offset

This link item is never generated by MACRO-80 nor by Nestor80.

### 9: External plus offset

Expressions involving external symbols are usually stored as the full collection of expression parts in postfix format, to be evaluated by the linker during the linking process; however, for expressions of type "symbol+value" there's this dedicated link item type. Of course, the value field is the value to be added and the symbol field is the external symbol name.

Note that "symbol-value" expressions get also an "external plus offset" link item (the offset is stored as a twos complement negative number).

### 10: Define size of data segment

The value is the size of the data segment, defined as the last address used in that segment. For example, this code:

```
dseg
org 100h
db 0
end
```

will generate a relocatable file whose size for the data segment will be 101h.

### 11: Set loading location counter

Indicates that further items are to be considered included in the absolute segment, the code segment, the data segment or a COMMON block starting at the specified address. `ASEG`, `CSEG`, `DSEG` and `COMMON` instructions will generate an item of this type (for COMMON blocks a "Select COMMON block" item is first used to specify the block name).

Changing to the absolute, code or data segments will set the location counter at the last used address for that segment plus one; changing to a COMMON block always sets the location counter to zero.

For example, the following code:

```
cseg
org 100h
db 1,2

dseg
org 10h
db 3,4,5,6

common /FOO/
db 7,8

cseg
db 9,10

dseg
db 11,12

common /FOO/
db 13,14

end
```

will generate a relocatable file with the following items:

```
Set loading location counter to: code segment 0100h
1,2

Set loading location counter to: data segment 0010h
3,4,5,6

Select COMMON block: FOO
Set loading location counter to: common block 0000h
7,8

Set loading location counter to: code segmment 0102h
9,10

Set loading location counte to: data segment 0014h
11,12

Select COMMON block: FOO
Set loading location counter: common block 0000h
13,14
```

### 12: Chain address

This item is similar to "Chain external" but is supposed used for relocatable addresses instead of external symbol references. However this item is never generrated by MACRO-80 or Nestor80.

### 13: Define size of code segment

The value is the size of the code segment, defined as the last address used in that segment. For example, this code:

```
cseg
org 100h
db 0
end
```

will generate a relocatable file whose size for the cpde segment will be 101h.

### 14: End of program

This item is generated by an `END` instruction found in code (or when the end of the source file is reached). The value of the item is the address passed as an argument to the `END` instruction if present, or absolute zero otherwise.

This item forces a byte boundary, this means that after the item as been written to the relocatable file as many zero bits are added so that the total number of written bytes is a multiple of 8.

### 15: End of file

This is the only link item that has neither a value nor a symbol field; thus its encoding in the relocatable file is the fixed sequence of bits `100 1111`. After this item is found the remaining content of the file (if any) is ignored.

## Extension link items

When the link item type code is "Extension link item" the symbol field of the item is to be interpreted as follows:

* First byte: Extension link item type code.
* Remaining bytes (up to 6): Depends on the type of extension link item.

The following extension link items are generated by MACRO-80 and Nestor80, they are used to represent expressions that need to be evaluated at link time (this happens for two reasons: expressions that contain external symbol references, and non-absolute values that need to be stored as one single byte).

### 41h: Arithmetic operator

The symbol bytes field will have two bytes: the fixed value 41h, and an arithmetic operator code. These are the defined arithmetic operator codes:

* 1: "Store as byte". Placed at the end of a list of link items that represent a postifx expression, indicates that the result of the expression is to be stored in the linked file as one single byte.
* 2: "Store as word". Placed at the end of a list of link items that represent a postifx expression, indicates that the result of the expression is to be stored in the linked file as a two bytes value.
* 3: "High byte" operator.
* 4: "Low byte" operator.
* 5: "Not" operator.
* 6: Unary minus.
* 7: Binary minus.
* 8: Plus.
* 9: Multiply.
* 10: Divide.
* 11: Module (remaining of integer division).

Note that not all the existing operators are in the list (e.g. AND, OR... are missing). Trying to use an unsupported operator in an expression with external symbol references will result in an error at assembly time.

Here's an example of a complete link item representing the "Not" operator:

```
100  0100    010       41h        05h
     type   length  ext. type  operator
```

### 42h: External symbol reference

The symbol bytes field will have one byte with the fixed value 42h, and then from one to six bytes with the ASCII representation of the symbol. Example for symbol `XYZ`:

```
100  0100    100       42h      XYZ
     type   length  ext. type  symbol
```

### 43h: Value

The symbol bytes field will have four bytes:

* The fixed value 43h
* The segment of the value (`00` = absolute, `01` = code, `10` = data, `11` = common)
* The low byte of the value
* the high byte of the value

Example for the value 1234h in the data segment:

```
100  0100    011       43h       02h     34h 12h
     type   length  ext. type  segment    value
```

### Example of link items group

The assembler instruction `LD A,3+(NOT FOO##)` would generate the following sequence of extension link items in the generated relocatable file (notice the postfix format
and the "Store as byte" operator, needed because the argument of `LD A,n` is one single byte):

```
Value, absolute 0003h
External symbol reference, FOO
Arithmetic operator, NOT
Arithmetic operator, Plus
Arithmetic operator, Store as byte
```
